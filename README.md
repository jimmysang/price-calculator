# price-calculator
It's a server side API that can takes in parameters of printing products and give the right price as response.

This project is a classic MVC mode API server, using Hibernate and Spring MVC. 

This was used to handle both requests from our desktop client and other website, so I use JavaScript callback function to handle Cross-site requests.
